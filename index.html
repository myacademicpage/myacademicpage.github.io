	In the Summer of 2022, I saw a tweet which said "If you're an academic without a website, you don't exist." It upset me. So, I made <a href="https://www.ozdoff.com">Ozdoff</a> to keep a list of personal academic webpages of my friends in order to make sure that they are alive. But it turns out some of my friends did not have webpages. So, I made this thing to make it as easy as possible for them. It works like this:
  <ol>
    <li>Create a new Spreadsheet in Google Sheets.
    <li>Put name in A1, picture in B1, occupation in C1 and aboutme in D1 (see the example below).
    <li>Fill the rest of the spreadsheet according to your needs (see the example below).
    <li>Click on share and make it Public (Anyone on the internet with the link can view.)
    <li>The URL for your spreadsheet looks like www.docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/A-STRING-OF-LETTERS-AND-NUMBERS/edit-bla-bla. You copy that "A-STRING-OF-LETTERS-AND-NUMBERS".
    <li>You fill <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScFPYdf6ivimnrU_4TSdygjzD4k_sBZb9soxXH8s_89WZugNA/viewform">this form</a>.
    <li>In 24 hours, you should have your site available at www.myacademic.page/your-choice-of-url.
  </ol>
  That's it. You do not have to sign up anywhere, provide me no other information than the few answers in the form and you will not receive any emails or anything from me (except the first, your page is now available mail). If you have any questions or comments, just fill <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSekvu5yzhp6AO9DL-S_NCB8IUC2jMrCzVXO4pFbwAkMBiALwA/viewform">this form to contact me</a>.

<br><br>

  I made this thing for my friends but if we are not really friends, you can <a href="https://www.buymeacoffee.com/ozguresentepe">buy me a coffee</a> and just write "I once bought you a coffee" as an answer to how we know each other in the google form.

  <br><br>

  There may be better alternatives out there. If you know them, let me know and I can make a list of them.
