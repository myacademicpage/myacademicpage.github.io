	In the Summer of 2022, I saw a tweet which said "If you're an academic without a website, you don't exist." It upset me. So, I made <a href="https://www.ozdoff.com">Ozdoff</a> to keep a list of personal academic webpages of my friends in order to make sure that they are alive. But it turns out some of my friends did not have webpages. So, I made this thing to make it as easy as possible for them. It works like this:
  <ol>
	  <li>Decide on your preferred URL. It will look like www.myacademic.page/your-preferred-url. In order to save everyone time, write that URL in your browser and make sure that it is not taken.
    <li>Create a new Spreadsheet in Google Sheets.
    <li>Put "name" in A1 and your name in "A2", "picture" in B1 and the url of a photo of yours in B2, "occupation" in C1 and your occupation in C2, and "aboutme" in D1 and then use Column D to fill the rest of the spreadsheet according to your needs (see the Example Sheet below).
    <li>Click on share and make your Google Sheet Public (Anyone on the internet with the link can view.)
    <li>The URL for your spreadsheet looks like www.docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/A-STRING-OF-LETTERS-AND-NUMBERS/edit-bla-bla. You copy that "A-STRING-OF-LETTERS-AND-NUMBERS".
    <li>You fill <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScGN310g2wRTpXC_Zugfb40l7dK_NctcFY0dLHwtEOJe8ozbQ/viewform">this form</a>.
    <li>Your site is available at www.myacademic.page/your-choice-of-url (give 5 minutes or so).
  </ol>
  That's it. You do not have to sign up anywhere, provide me no other information than the few answers in the form and you will not receive any emails or anything from me. If you have any questions or comments, just fill <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSekvu5yzhp6AO9DL-S_NCB8IUC2jMrCzVXO4pFbwAkMBiALwA/viewform">this form to contact me</a>.

  <br><br>

  There may be better/other alternatives out there. If you know them, let me know and I will add a list of them here. If you like this idea and want to buy me a coffee, <a href="https://www.buymeacoffee.com/ozguresentepe">you can do so here</a>.
